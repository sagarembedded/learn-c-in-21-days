# Day 01 – Exercises

This file contains exercises for Day 01 – **Introduction to C & Environment Setup**.  

Exercises are divided into **two sections**:

1. Conceptual Questions  
2. Practical C Coding Exercises

## 1️⃣ Conceptual Questions

Answer the following questions to strengthen your understanding of basic C concepts:

1. What is the significance of `#include <stdio.h>` in a C program?  
2. Explain the purpose of the `main()` function.  
3. Why do we use `return 0;` at the end of `main()`?  
4. What are constants in C, and why are they useful?  
5. Name at least three features of the C programming language.  
6. What is the difference between `printf()` and `scanf()`?  
7. Explain the difference between a **variable** and a **constant**.  
8. What does the `int` in `int main()` signify?  
9. What are some common data types in C?  
10. Why is commenting code important, especially for beginners?

## 2️⃣ Practical C Coding Exercises

Below are **5 coding exercises** related to Day 01 topics. Try to implement these programs using **VS Code** or **GCC**.

---

### **Exercise 1 – Print Your Name and Age**

- Write a program to print your **name** and **age** in separate lines.  
- Use `printf()` and proper comments for each line.

**Example Output:**
* Name: Alice
* Age: 22


---

### **Exercise 2 – Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division**

- Modify the `addition.c` example to also calculate **difference, product, and quotient**.  
- Take two integers as input and display all four results.

**Sample Output:**

* Enter two numbers: 10 5
* Sum = 15
* Difference = 5
* Product = 50
* Quotient = 2


---

### **Exercise 3 – Circle Calculations**

- Expand `variables_constants.c` to calculate **area** and **circumference** of a circle.  
- Use `const` for PI and proper comments.

**Sample Output:**

* Enter radius of circle: 3
* Area = 28.27
* Circumference = 18.85

---

### **Exercise 4 – Simple Temperature Converter**

- Write a program that converts **Celsius to Fahrenheit**.  
- Formula: `F = (C * 9/5) + 32`

**Sample Output:**

* Enter temperature in Celsius: 25
* Temperature in Fahrenheit: 77.0

---

### **Exercise 5 – Using Multiple Variables**

- Declare **3 integer variables**, assign values, and print their **sum, average, and product**.  
- Include comments for every line.

**Sample Output:**

* Enter three integers: 4 5 6
* Sum = 15
* Average = 5
* Product = 120

---

> 💡 **Tips for Day 01 Exercises:**

- Comment **every line** while practicing.  
- Use meaningful **variable names**.  
- Test programs with **different inputs** to ensure correctness.  
- Save all your programs in the `examples/` folder for consistency.
